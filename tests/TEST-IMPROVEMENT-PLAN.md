# Cascade Test Improvement Plan

This document outlines the plan for improving and maintaining the test coverage for the Cascade platform.

## Current Test Structure

The test workspace is organized into three main categories:

1. **E2E Tests**: End-to-end tests that verify the complete system behavior from external interfaces
2. **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify the integration between different parts of the system
3. **BDD Tests**: Behavior-driven tests that verify business requirements using Gherkin syntax

## Known Issues

The current test suite has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Several dependencies are declared but not properly installed or configured
2. **API Version Mismatches**: The test code is using outdated API versions in certain places
3. **Type Mismatches**: There are type mismatches between the test code and the underlying libraries
4. **Structure Issues**: The test structure is not properly aligned with the workspace structure
5. **Incomplete Implementations**: Some test implementations are incomplete or contain errors
6. **Over-reliance on Mocks**: Many tests use excessive mocking, making them brittle and less valuable

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Structural Issues

1. âœ… Establish proper workspace organization with consistent directory structure
2. âœ… Fix Cargo.toml files to properly declare dependencies and features
3. âœ… Create lib.rs files for each test crate to export shared functionality
4. âœ… Fix type mismatches in world.rs and other core files

### Phase 2: Strategic Mock Reduction

1. ðŸ”„ Audit existing tests and categorize mocks as:
   - Essential (external services, network-dependent resources)
   - Non-essential (internal components that could use real implementations)
2. ðŸ”„ Create a test doubles hierarchy:
   - Stub: Simple return values for non-critical paths
   - Mock: Behavior verification for critical interactions
   - Fake: Lightweight in-memory implementations where appropriate
3. ðŸ”„ Implement a "real components first" policy for integration tests
4. â¬œ Create in-memory implementations of key services for faster, more reliable testing

### Phase 3: Update Test Implementations

1. ðŸ”„ Update BDD step definitions to use the latest API versions
2. ðŸ”„ Fix the cucumber implementation to use the correct interfaces
3. ðŸ”„ Ensure E2E tests can be run independently and in sequence
4. â¬œ Implement proper error handling in all tests
5. â¬œ Gradually replace unnecessary mocks with real implementations

### Phase 4: Improve Test Coverage

1. â¬œ Add tests for edge cases not currently covered
2. â¬œ Implement performance tests to verify system under load
3. â¬œ Add more integrations tests for new components
4. â¬œ Implement property-based testing for core functionality

### Phase 5: CI/CD Integration

1. â¬œ Configure CI to run tests automatically on PRs
2. â¬œ Add test coverage reporting
3. â¬œ Add integration with code quality tools
4. â¬œ Implement automatic test regression detection

## Strategic Mock Reduction Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- **Keep**: Mocks for external dependencies (databases, APIs, message queues)
- **Keep**: Mocks for slow operations or those with side effects
- **Reduce**: Mocks for simple internal utilities or pure functions
- **Replace**: Complex mocks with simpler stubs when behavior verification isn't critical

### Integration Tests

- **Keep**: Mocks for third-party services that are difficult to provision in test
- **Reduce**: Mocks for internal components that should be tested together
- **Replace**: Mocked databases with in-memory test databases
- **Introduce**: Lightweight fakes for complex subsystems when needed

### E2E Tests

- **Keep**: Only the minimum mocks needed for test stability
- **Reduce**: Most internal component mocks in favor of real implementations
- **Replace**: API mocks with controlled test endpoints
- **Set up**: Dedicated test environments with realistic configurations

## Test Categories to Improve

### E2E Tests

- â¬œ Add more comprehensive HTTP flow tests
- â¬œ Implement full order processing workflow tests with minimal mocking
- â¬œ Add error handling and recovery tests with realistic failure scenarios

### Integration Tests

- â¬œ Refactor to use real component implementations where possible
- â¬œ Create in-memory implementations of core services
- â¬œ Add more database interaction tests with test databases

### BDD Tests

- â¬œ Fix cucumber implementation
- â¬œ Add missing step definitions
- â¬œ Reduce reliance on mocks in favor of test doubles that more closely resemble real behavior

## Key Metrics for Test Quality

1. **Test Coverage**: Aim for 80%+ code coverage
2. **Test Pass Rate**: Maintain 98%+ passing rate
3. **Test Execution Time**: Keep full test suite under 5 minutes
4. **Test Isolation**: Ensure all tests can run independently
5. **Mock Ratio**: Reduce non-essential mocks by 50% in integration and E2E tests

## Implementation Timeline

- Phase 1: 1 week (completed)
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 3 weeks
- Phase 5: 2 weeks

Total: 10 weeks to complete all improvements
